At least 12 dead after terror attack at Paris newspaper office (+video),"gunmen stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper charlie hebdo on wednesday. french president francois hollande called the deadly assault a terrorist attack.

why is angela merkel calling for a ban on the full islamic veil?

masked gunmen shouting ""allahu akbar!"" stormed the paris offices of a satirical newspaper wednesday, killing 12 people including the editor and a cartoonist before escaping. it was france's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades.

with a manhunt on, french president francois hollande called the attack on the charlie hebdo weekly, whose caricatures of the prophet muhammed have frequently drawn condemnation from muslims, ""a terrorist attack without a doubt."" he said several other attacks have been thwarted in france ""in recent weeks.""

there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

france raised its security alert to the highest level and reinforced protective measures at houses of worship, stores, media offices and transportation. top government officials were holding an emergency meeting and hollande planned a nationally televised address in the evening. schools across the french capital closed their doors.

world leaders including president barack obama and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the attack, but supporters of the militant islamic state group celebrated the slayings as well-deserved revenge against france.

the islamic state group has repeatedly threatened to attack france. just minutes before the attack, charlie hebdo had tweeted a satirical cartoon of that extremist group's leader giving new year's wishes. another cartoon, released in this week's issue and entitled ""still no attacks in france,"" had a caricature of an extremist fighter saying ""just wait — we have until the end of january to present our new year's wishes.""

the 12 dead included two men who went by the pen names: charb — the editor and a cartoonist as well — and the cartoonist cabu, spokeswoman agnes thibault-lecuivre of the paris prosecutor's office confirmed.

two police officers were also among the dead, including one assigned as charb's bodyguard after prior death threats against him, a police official told the associated press, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.

just before noon, multiple masked men armed with automatic weapons attacked the newspaper's office in central paris, nearby worker benoit bringer told the itele network. the attackers went to the second floor and started firing indiscriminately in the newsroom, said christophe deloire of reporters without borders.

""this is the darkest day of the history of the french press,"" deloire said.

video images on the website of public broadcaster france televisions showed two gunmen in black at a crossroads who appeared to fire down one of the streets. a cry of ""allahu akbar!"" — arabic for ""god is great""— could be heard among the gunshots.

luc poignant of the sbp police union said the attackers left in a waiting car and later switched to another vehicle that had been stolen.

obama's top spokesman said us officials have been in close contact with the french since the attack. ""we know they are not going to be cowed by this terrible act,"" spokesman josh earnest said.

on social media, supporters of militant islamic groups praised the move. one twitter user who identified themselves as a tunisian loyalist of al qaeda and the islamic state group called the attack well-deserved revenge against france.

elsewhere on the internet, the hashtag #jesuischarlie was trending as people expressed support for weekly and for journalistic freedom.

charlie hebdo has been repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the prophet muhammad and other controversial sketches. its offices were firebombed in 2011 after a spoof issue featuring a caricature of the prophet on its cover. nearly a year later, the publication again published crude muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations from around the muslim world.

wednesday's attack comes the same day of the release of a book by a celebrated french novelist depicting france's election of its first muslim president. hollande had been due to meet with the country's top religious officials later in the day.",REAL,0,0.5,FAKE

An Open Letter to Black South African Police Officers,"tweet widget by black power front 
with students joining workers in revolt against south africa’s neoliberal regime, young people are demanding to know why black police are engaged in the same kind of repression that was previously used by white governments “to systematically counter black resistance?” in a letter to black cops, activists note “an increase and worrying pattern of anti-black police violence.” an open letter to black south african police officers by black power front 
“as a black police officer, you must understand that the struggles of black workers and students are actually your struggles too.” 
dear black police officer, 
how are you today? well, we hope. you may be wondering who we are, why we have decided to write to you and perhaps why we are addressing you as a “black police officer” -- as opposed to just saying “police officer.” 
who are we? we are the black power front or bpf. we are a non-party political pro-black platform which seeks to serve as an instrument to organize and collaborate with like-minded black individuals and organizations, under a common program that provides practical responses to what is commonly understood as the black condition today. 
why have we decided to write to you? first, given the nature of your work, it is not always easy to sit down with you and just talk about issues that affect our country and, in particular, the black community. 
second, like other members of the black community, we in the bpf are deeply disturbed by the continued brutality of the police against black workers and students -- particularly those who engage in legitimate protest action. and third, the bpf holds the view that, given where black people find themselves economically, socially and otherwise today in relation to other racial groups, it is extremely urgent that like-minded black groups and individuals (everywhere in the world) come together in exclusive spaces, and engage in constructive dialogue, with the view to find ways of getting black people out of the quagmire they currently find themselves in. 
the anti-black role of the police before 1994 
as members of the black community, you would know that, in the azanian (south afrikan) context, from the 1400s onwards, various forms of colonial police structures were key instruments in enabling the european invaders to advance and bolster their evil agenda of slavery, colonization and land theft. it was these colonial police structures that were used to systematically counter black resistance, through amongst others the capture, torture and in many cases beheading of our warrior ancestors such as ukumkani uhintsa, kgosi toto, kgosi galeshewe, ukumkani ustuurman and many other heroes and heroines of black resistance. 
in the 20 th century, it was through these european colonial police structures that successive white supremacist regimes in azania (south afrika) were able to murder and torture our freedom fighters and ordinary black people. they were directly responsible for the murder of our people in sharpeville and langa in 1960. the execution by hanging of martyrs like vuyisile mini and solomon mahlangu, in 1964 and 1979, respectively. 
it was the colonial european police who assassinated visionaries such as onkgopotse tiro and steve biko, in 1974 and 1977, respectively. it was them who murdered the young zolile petersen and christopher truter, during the student uprising of 1976. and it was them who ensured that many of our revered freedom fighters such as kgalabi masemola, mangaliso sobukwe, lekoane mothopeng, pandelani nefolovhodwe, nkosi molala, muntu myeza and many others, were banished to robben island. 
even though it is often argued that the white police officers who were involved in these atrocities against black people were acting under the orders of their superiors, the truth of the matter is that, at an individual and basic level, they knew that what they were doing to black people was wrong, inhumane and unjustified. 
the anti-black role of the police after 1994 
given this painful history of centuries of systematic and state violence against black people, the declaration of “freedom” on april 27, 1994, created a legitimate expectation on the part of many black people that the type of wanton violence and naked brutality that the successive colonial white supremacist regimes unleashed on black people would be a thing of the past. but to our horror, even after the declaration of “freedom” in 1994 and the installation of a government that is led by black people we began to see an increase and worrying pattern of anti-black police violence. 
this type of anti-black police [u1] brutality was palpable in the killing of andries tatane, young nqobile nzuza, mike tshele, lerato seema, osiah rahube, jan rivombo and of course the brutal and targeted assassinations of mgcineni “mambush” noki and other black workers in marikana, in august 2012. 
all of these anti-black atrocities beg the question: how it is possible that a government that is led by people who, as part of the black community, have first-hand experience of the brutality of state violence through the police, do not just unleash the same type of state violence against their own people, but also seek to justify the use of such anti-black violence? 
our attitude towards black police officers 
by highlighting the involvement of black policer officers (after 1994) in the killing of ordinary black people who are simply fighting for their right to be human the bpf does not seek to create the mind-set that black police officers are the enemy of the black community or that black police officers are inherently bad people. of course, there are many examples of black police officers who don’t just do their job with integrity and dedication, but also do a lot of good work in the black community. 
this notwithstanding, the main focus of this letter, however, is not so much the individual conduct of black police officers but rather the continued use of black police officers (as a state function) in the brutal suppression of the right of ordinary and mainly poor black people to freely articulate their social, economic and political concerns and aspirations. 
our appeal to black police officers 
as the bpf, we regard black police officers as members of the black community first and therefore an integral part of black life in azania. we also hold the view that the on-going demands by black workers for decent wages and better working conditions or those of black students for free-decolonized-afrocentric education, are not just demands that will benefit individual black police officers (majority of them black young people), but also their children who might be at university or will be going there in future. therefore, as a black police officer, you must understand that the struggles of black workers and students are actually your struggles too. 
as the bpf we fully understand that, just like all ordinary black people, black police officers are under severe financial stress and like most black people, they are struggling to make ends meet. for these reasons, the bpf’s clarion call to all black police officers is as follows: 
* understand that the economic struggles and frustrations of ordinary black people are your struggles and frustrations too. and that black workers and students continue to be oppressed by the same system that is responsible for your personal financial stress; 
* as part of the black community, you must (through your labor unions), engage the management of the saps to stop the state’s campaign of apartheid-style violence that is currently being unleashed on black people in general; 
* you are our black brothers and sisters and must never allow yourselves to be used by self-serving politicians as part of an elitist anti-black-pro-capitalist plot that uses the pretext of “law and order” to justify the murder of poor black people and wanting that black people timidly accept their status as economic slaves in the land of their ancestors; and 
* lastly, black students and workers are not fighting against you (as black police officers) but against the anti-black-pro-capitalist system that is using some of you against your own black sisters and brothers.

US Spy Chief: Asking North Korea To Stop Nuke Program a ‘Lost Cause’,"get short url 0 27 0 0 on tuesday, national intelligence director james clapper said that the us must focus on limiting north korea’s nuclear capabilities, because convincing the isolated country to halt nuclear development is a “lost cause.” 
pyongyang has conducted over 20 ballistic missile tests this year and two nuclear explosions. there is concern in washington that the dprk could be developing a weapon that could reach the american mainland. their most recent underground nuclear explosion took place in early september. © ap photo/ wong maye-e us still committed to denuclearization process in north korea at the council on foreign relations, clapper said ""i think the notion of getting the north koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause…they are not going to do that — that is their ticket to survival."" 
washington has consistently maintained its position on not recognizing north korea as a nuclear-armed state. numerous sanctions, and negotiations to trade aid in exchange for disarmament have not stopped pyongyang’s nuclear program. despite this, the us state department announced that it will continue to demand the communist country’s denuclearization. 
clapper described his trip to north korea in 2014 to secure the release of two americans, saying it gave him a ""good taste"" of the country’s perspective on nuclear development. © ap photo/ koji sasahara north korea blasts us, japan, south korea for 'destabilizing northeast asia' ""they are under siege and they are very paranoid, so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a non-starter with them…the best we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap, but they are not going to do that just because we ask them. there's going to have to be some significant inducements."" 
defense experts in the us believe pyongyang currently has between 13-21 nuclear weapons, and by 2020 could have as many as 100. 
state department spokesman john kirby told reporters in washington that he had not seen clapper’s comments, and that the us still hopes to resume aid-for-disarmament negotiations, which have been stalled since pyongyang pulled out in 2009. © reuters/ kcna us announces extended deterrence doctrine against north korea

The Devastating Consequences Of A 'Small' Rise In Global Temperatures,"more floods, more drought inevitable. how bad do we want it to get?

world leaders are meeting in paris this month in what amounts to a last-ditch effort to avert the worst ravages of climate change. climatologists now say that the best case scenario — assuming immediate and dramatic emissions curbs — is that planetary surface temperatures will increase by at least 2 degrees celsius in the coming decades.

this may sound like a small uptick, but the implications are profound. rising temperatures will destroy plant and animal habitats, and reduce yields of important food crops. more people will be exposed to the ravages of flooding and drought.

but if the nations involved in the paris talks stay on their current emissions track and don’t reduce greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures could go up by almost 6 degrees celsius this century, according to the committee on climate change, an independent body that advises the u.k. government on climate issues.

the consequences of a heating globe are already being felt in alaska, which is warming twice as fast as the rest of the u.s. rising temperatures have thawed frozen soil in some areas, leaving coastlines vulnerable to storms and tidal activity. shishmaref, a remote village that sits on an island 30 miles outside the arctic circle, is losing as many as 9 feet of land a year — chunks of coastline that simply break into the sea.

each year, more species are losing their habitats to climate change. an increase of 4 degrees celsius in average planetary temperatures could result in severe habitat loss for almost two-thirds of plant species and one-third of mammal species. species losing at least half their habitat source: committee on climate change

crop estimates assume that crop varieties and planting times are adjusted to optimize yeild. plant and animal estimates assume that species disperse to new areas at historically observed rates. charts show median estimates.

even if nations meeting in paris curtail carbon emissions, a growing number of communities will be exposed to threats caused by climate change. vulnerable populations that live near water or in arid places will face massive disruptions to their way of life: flooding and severe drought are on course to become much more common.

human activity since industrialization has led to a huge increase in the production of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to rising global temperatures. scientists warn that if carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rates, earth’s temperatures could increase dramatically in future decades, leading to catastrophic and irreversible climate change. the 10 largest emitters produced about 26.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2013. (a gigaton is 1 billion tons, or roughly the equivalent of the annual emissions from every passenger car in the u.s. each year.) they are highlighted in red.

countries producing most of the world’s carbon promise big cuts countries responsible for two-thirds of global emissions have made commitments to curb their greenhouse gas production. that group includes some of the biggest emitters like china, india and the u.s. china, the world’s biggest carbon producer, has promised that its carbon emissions will peak by 2030. projected emissions by 2019, in gigatons of carbon dioxide china will aim to reach maximum carbon emissions by 2030. after that, it will lower its carbon dioxide emissions by 60 to 65 percent relative to 2005 levels. by 2025, the u.s. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent relative to 2005 levels. by 2030, the eu aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent relative to 1990 levels. by 2030, the eu aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent relative to 1990 levels. by 2030, india aims to reduce the ratio of emissions to its gdp by 33 to 35 percent relative to 2005 levels. by 2030, india aims to reduce the ratio of emissions to its gdp by 33 to 35 percent relative to 2005 levels.",REAL,0,0.5,FAKE
"Cost, logistics of Obama immigration plan raise concerns before launch","president obama’s executive action sparing millions of illegal immigrants from deportation will be the biggest federal program rollout since obamacare -- and administration officials are hoping its launch, set for may, will be a lot smoother.

“the deputy secretary and i are very focused on this, and i believe we're going to get it right,” department of homeland security secretary jeh johnson told fox news on thursday.

still, republican opposition to the plan that would block deportation of as many as 5 million illegal immigrants -- most of them parents of children already here legally -- is nearly as intense.

dhs has leased a massive office building in crystal city, virginia, just across the potomac river from washington, where a thousand federal workers and a thousand more contractors will process applications. though forecasting turn-out of applicants is largely a guessing game, dhs predicts as many as 1.3 million people may apply in the first six months alone.

the crystal city office demonstrates to critics just one of many problems with the president’s executive action. ""those employees are not going to ask people from all over the country to come to crystal city to be interviewed. they're not going to be effectively interviewed. they’re going to do online most of their work,"" said senator jeff sessions, r-ala.  he believes the online interview process is a recipe for fraud.

there's also the cost of the plan -- officially known as deferred action for parents of americans  -- estimated at $324 million to $484 million over the next few years, according to dhs documents obtained by the los angeles times.

supporters note taxpayers won't be footing that bill – they say applicants will instead, through a $465 fee. ""the program operates slowly and exclusively on the funds that are contributed by those that participate in the program, said rep. luis gutierrez, d., ill.

“you get a million of them to apply, you have $500 million,” he said.

""that’s an absolute misrepresentation,” said sessions. “congress has the power to control all money, whether it comes in by fee, or not.""

even with a fee-based payment, sessions said immigration and customs enforcement is already overburdened by the wave of childhood arrivals and will  be further hard pressed by the new plan to carry out basic enforcement duties.

“they've told us they're unable now to do their job. they've made clear that it’s placing america at risk. now we're talking about another five million the president wants to be reviewed for legal status,"" he added.

sessions warned the plan will lower wages in an already job-scarce economy, while gutierrez said applicants toil at jobs many americans refuse to do.

“who does he really think is going to pick those onions in 110 degrees in south texas?” asked gutierrez. “seventy percent of the agricultural workers that do the picking, that do the hard labor, are undocumented, we know that. so let's not kid ourselves, the folks are already here working.”

by coming out of the shadows through the plan, many immigrants could also suddenly find themselves subject to the maze of tax laws, tax penalties, loopholes and liabilities and benefits  that u.s. citizens already face, a confounding code that could potentially drive some applicants back into the shadows.
